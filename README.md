In this project, I developed a garage management system that efficiently manages various vehicle types, such as motorcycles, cars, and trucks, each with specific properties like fuel type and battery capacity. The system supports functionalities like refueling, recharging, and tracking vehicle status within the garage. It uses object-oriented programming principles, including inheritance and polymorphism, and incorporates enums and exception handling for robust error management. The project is structured to separate the logical operations from the user interface, enhancing maintainability and scalability. External assemblies (DLLs) were used to modularize the code further.
