The task involves developing a garage management system using object-oriented programming principles in C#. The primary objectives include implementing inheritance, polymorphism, and collections, using enums, handling exceptions, and working with external assemblies (DLLs). The system will manage different types of vehicles, each with specific properties and functionalities, such as refueling and recharging. The solution will include multiple projects to separate the logical layer from the user interface, ensuring a clean and maintainable code structure.
